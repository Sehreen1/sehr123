CAPSTONE HEALTHCARE PROJECT

DESCRIPTION

NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
 
 Dataset Description
 
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

 

Variables	Description

Pregnancies	Number of times pregnant

Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness	Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin	Two hour serum insulin

BMI	Body Mass Index

DiabetesPedigreeFunction	Diabetes pedigree function

Age	Age in years

Outcome	Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0






Employee Turnover Analysis

DESCRIPTION 

This is a project for Simplilearn. An app innovator who has devised an intelligent way of predicting employee turnover within the company. It periodically evaluates employees' work details, including the number of projects they worked on, average monthly working hours, time spent in the company, promotions in the last five years, and salary level.

Data from prior evaluations shows the employees’ satisfaction in the workplace. The data could be used to identify patterns in work style and their interest in continuing to work for the company.

The HR Department owns the data and uses it to predict employee turnover. Employee turnover refers to the total number of workers who leave a company over time.

The goals are:

Understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover at EDA.
Perform clustering of employees who left based on their satisfaction and evaluation.
Handle the left Class Imbalance using the SMOTE technique.
Perform k-fold cross-validation model training and evaluate performance.
